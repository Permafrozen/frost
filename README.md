## About

This is my personal website utilized for showcasing my projects and hosting documentation. It is built with `svelte`  and hosted on github pages.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
## Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions. It is triggered by pushing a commit to the `main` branch.
